## My Project

This project walks you through how you can deploy a ControleNet model with Stable Diffusion on SageMaker endpoint using Multi-Model approach and Single-model approach. 
* For the multi-model deployment approach please run the ControlNet-MME.ipynb
* For the single mode deployment approach please run the ControlNet.ipynb

## Set Up StreamLit Front-End

The streamlit app for this prioject is located in *app_complete.py*.

To run this Streamlit App on Sagemaker Studio follow the steps in the link below:
* [Set Up SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-quick-start.html)
* [Launch SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-launch.html)
* [Clone this git repo into studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-tasks-git.html)
* In the app_complete.py script, change the values for the variables `ENDPOINT` to the name of the endpoint hosting the models and `BUCKET` to the name of the bucket to hold the input and output images.
* Open a system terminal by clicking on **Amazon SageMaker Studio** and then **System Terminal** as shown in the diagram below
* <img src="images/studio-new-launcher.png" width="600"/>
* Navigate into the cloned repository directory using the `cd` command and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the needed python libraries
* Run command `python3 -m streamlit run app_complete.py` to start the Streamlit server. Do not use the links generated by the command as they won't work in studio.
* To enter the Streamlit app, open and run the **Streamlit_app.ipynb** notebook. This will generate the appropiate link to enter your Streamlit app from SageMaker studio. Click on the link to enter your Streamlit app. Happy querying :)
* **âš  Note:**  If you rerun the Streamlit server it may use a different port. Take not of the port used (port number is the last 4 digit number after the last :) and modify the `port` variable in the `Streamlit_app.ipynb` notebook to get the correct link.

To run this Streamlit App on AWS EC2 (I tested this on the Ubuntu Image)
* [Create a new ec2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
* Expose TCP port range 8500-9000 on Inbound connections of the attached Security group to the ec2 instance. TCP port 8501 is needed for Streamlit to work. See image below
* <img src="images/sg-rules.PNG" height="600"/>
* [Connect to your ec2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html)
* Run the appropiate commands to update the ec2 instance (`sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` -for Ubuntu)
* Clone this git repo `git clone [github_link]`
* In the app_complete.py script, change the values for the variables `ENDPOINT` to the name of the endpoint hosting the models and `BUCKET` to the name of the bucket to hold the input and output images. Make use of the `nano` command to make this changes. e.g. `nano app_complete.py`
* Install python3 and pip if not already installed
* Install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file by running the command `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run command `python3 -m streamlit run app_complete.py` 
* Copy the external link and paste in a new browser tab
